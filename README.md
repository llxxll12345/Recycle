- The goal is to finetune Networks such as MobileNet to classify and detect recyclable objects
- The current dataset is found on the Internet, and will add more images in the future.
- Current Result: Around 65% overall validation accuracy. The next step would be to update the model and update the dataset.
- Possibly will do object detection in the future.
